                <p>My name is Shruti Tokekar. I am from Sayreville, NJ. I am A Computer Science Student at Middlesex College pursuing my Associate degree. My plan after getting my associate's to transfer to NJIT. I will work on getting my Bachelor's in Computer Science and minor in business and informational technology. Furthering my education, I will get my master's degree in AI. My future career goals are to work on modifying AI in big companies such as Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, etc. 
                    I find AI to be very fascinating and want to become an AI software developer. I was talked to looking into AI and Data Analyst jobs since The demand for AI has risen exponentially. Now every single company has its own AI assistant and its own intelligence. I do think it will keep rising ove the span of time.
                    When learning about computers, I have worked with both software and hardware. At an early age, My father introduced me to the world of computers. That's when I started messing around with PCs and modifying the RAM and video graphic cards. Then I discovered the realm of coding where I was working with different languages such as Python, C, java,HTML/CSS and JavaScript. Hardware and Software modification is what brought me to major in computer science. 
                    Other than working with different computers, I also have an interest in art. I have been painting and drawing for over 10+ years. This artistic ability has brought me to the discovery of graphic design where I helped make flyers for small businesses as well as logos. This interest in art and technology is what brought me to combine design with functionality in tech.
