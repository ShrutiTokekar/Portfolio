                    <p class = "td_font">As a Computer Science student working toward my Associate's Degree, I’m passionate about software development, artificial intelligence, and using technology to solve real-world problems. Born in India and raised in New Jersey, I grew up surrounded by tech thanks to my father, a Software Engineer. His guidance introduced me to programming at an early age, and I quickly became fascinated by the possibilities of coding. This early exposure sparked my interest in pursuing a career in tech, leading me to focus on software development, machine learning, and data analytics at Middlesex College.</p>
                    <p class = "td_font">Over the course of my studies, I’ve gained valuable hands-on experience that has solidified my technical skills and problem-solving abilities. One of the highlights of my education so far was working on a machine learning project where I built a predictive model using real-world data. Not only did this experience sharpen my coding skills, but it also showed me the power of AI to drive meaningful change. I’m constantly pushing myself to learn more, take on new challenges, and expand my knowledge of emerging technologies. Whether it's through class projects, internships, or personal coding experiments, I’m always looking for opportunities to grow and refine my skills.</p>
                    <p class = "td_font" id = "p_align">As I approach graduation, I’m eager to bring my passion for technology and my technical skills into a professional environment. I’m particularly interested in software development and AI, and I’m excited about the chance to contribute to projects that tackle real-world problems. I’m looking for an opportunity where I can collaborate with a team of like-minded individuals, continue learning, and help create innovative solutions that make a difference. I’m confident that my dedication, strong problem-solving mindset, and drive to learn will allow me to add value to any tech team.</p>
